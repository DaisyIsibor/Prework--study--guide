<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>!DOCTYPE html: This is letting the browser to expect HTML on the page</li>
  <li>html lang="en" : This tells the browser that it's the beginning of an HTML file and the language is in English</li>
  <li>Meta tags: These are set of tags that tell the search engine what your webpage is about and it always goes with the HEAD tag</li>
  <LI>Img src= : This is to enable the image link load </LI>
  <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors,aesthetics,visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS(Inline CSS,Internal CSS style sheet and External CSS style sheet)</li>
          <li>>To style an element directly in the HTML file, we use INLINE CSS.
          <li>Internal style sheet can be configured to affect specific element on the code</li>
          <li>External style sheet is commonly used by developers because it allows us keep all the CSS rules in a separate file which makes design changes easier.
            >With external style sheet, We link the file using the LINK element placed in the HTML</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website</li>
          <li>In javascript, to declare a variable, we use the word "var" after Var we give the key word a unique name because that is how we refer to the information stored in the variable of our code. 
            We then assign the operator'=' to assign the specific data we want stored in our variable.</li>
            <li>Each lines of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon(;)</li>
            <li>Console.log: Console refers to a test environment used by developers to check out their code, .log() is a method that set of instructions can be executed by a computer 
            </li>
            <li>You can open chromeDevTool in the command on windows (Control+Shift+I).
              >OR on the browser page, right click and click inspect and navigate to the console tab.
             
             The console tab is to check the code we added if registered with the webpage.
             </li>
             <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, so the order needs to be correct and clear</li>
             <li>Conditional logic uses the statement (IF) Truthy or (IF) Falsy</li>
             <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>

              <h3> Incorporate arrays and FOR loops</h3>
             </p>
             &nbsp;
             <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, the are typically used to hold data that are related in some ways. E.G var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"]; JavaScript array starts with a 0 index</li>
             <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
             <li>We use FOR loop if we have too many items in our array</li>
             <li>Commenting out: this is a code that makes it inactive without deleting, just incase it's needed later on ( /* before */)</li>
              <p>
                &nbsp;
                <h2>FUNCTION</h2>
              </p>

              &nbsp;
              <li>A function is a set of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a certain task
                Functions are also resusable blocks of code that contains instructions to perform a specific task </li>
                <li>The two requirements for a JavaScript function (Define a function and call a function)</li>
                <li>To write a function (e.g Function helloworld(){console.log("Hello,world,i am a function!")}  but with out calling the function it will not work,)
                  So to call a function, we complete the code by typing (E.G helloWorld() ) This is how to call a function to make it work.
                  
                </li>
<li> Lastly Math function: this is a function used to select random numbers in a code (E.G math.random() and math.floor() these can be used together to generate a random number, it is a property of JavaScript)
</li>      
        </ul>
<p>
  &nbsp;
  Example of a loop pattern
  
</p>

<p>
  
  var x = 0;
  x < shapes.length;
  x++
</p>
&nbsp;
  <p>
  for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
   // code block
  }
</p>

  
  In JavaScript array, we can log our array e.g
  
    <p>console.log(shapes[0];)</p>

   <p> console.log(shapes[1];)</p>
